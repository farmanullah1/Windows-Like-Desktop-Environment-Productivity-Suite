## 1. Truth in Engineering Classification Model

To preserve product integrity and prevent misrepresentation, every subsystem and application in the suite is assigned an unambiguous classification:

| Classification | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **REAL** | Fully implemented, genuine application functionality running directly within the client/server runtime. |
| **WINDOWS-INTEGRATED** | Genuine integration with the host Windows OS via vetted Node APIs, WMI/CIM queries, or controlled PowerShell bridges. |
| **APPLICATION-SIMULATED** | Sophisticated desktop environment behavior managed strictly within the application's canvas/windowing engine (not replacing Windows OS equivalents). |
| **INFORMATIONAL** | Read-only inspection or telemetry display; does not modify or configure the underlying operating system. |
| **FUTURE** | Architected and designed in schema/specs, but deferred to future release milestones. |
| **UNSUPPORTED** | Intentionally blocked or technically unsupported due to OS security boundaries, safety policies, or stability constraints. |

## 3. Windows Integration API Safety Policy

In strict compliance with **Section 2.1 (Build-First / User-Authorized Execution Only)** and **Section 21 (Windows Integration API Matrix)**:

1. **Read Operations**: Safe read-only metrics (CPU, Memory, OS Version, Non-sensitive processes) are permitted via verified Node.js standard libraries and non-invasive CIM queries.
2. **Write Operations**: Operations modifying system state (terminating third-party processes, writing to system directories, modifying Windows services) are locked behind explicit user confirmation dialogs and administrative authorization gates.
3. **Protected Paths**: All filesystem operations strictly forbid tampering with `C:\Windows`, `C:\Program Files`, `C:\ProgramData`, System32, WinSxS, and user credential vaults.
4. **No Arbitrary Shell Execution**: The terminal application enforces a strict command allowlist and parameter sanitizer. Arbitrary `powershell.exe -EncodedCommand` or destructive shell piping is prohibited.
