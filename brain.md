# Project Identity
**Project Name:** Windows-Like Desktop Environment & Productivity Suite
**Codename:** Antigravity Desktop OS Workspace (ADW-6)
**Version:** 6.2.0 (Master Architecture Specification)
**Role:** Senior Production Desktop & Full-Stack System Architect

# Product Vision
A serious, production-grade desktop application platform designed for Windows 10/11 combining the workflow strengths of:
- **Windows 11 (40%):** Start Menu, Taskbar, System Tray, Quick Settings, Action Center notifications, Fluent depth & mica/acrylic surfaces, window snap layouts, widgets.
- **macOS (30%):** Dock, refined typography, smooth springs & transitions, workspace-centric navigation, application launcher, subtle glass translucency.
- **Ubuntu/Linux (30%):** Virtual workspaces, application overview switcher, keyboard-first command palette, developer tooling & terminal center, system transparency.
The outcome is a single, cohesive, original desktop environment that delivers high-performance productivity without looking like an operating system collage.

# Design System
- Semantic CSS Custom Properties tokens for color, typography, spacing, border-radius, elevation shadows, blur, and opacity.
- Zero reliance on bloated generic utility frameworks.

# Theme System
- Themes: Light, Dark, High Contrast, Midnight, Graphite, Aurora, Ocean, Ubuntu-Dark.
- Dynamic wallpaper-derived accent color extraction and ambient glow.

# Animation System
- GPU-accelerated CSS transforms and spring-interpolated transitions.
- Durations: Micro (100ms), Normal (200ms), Panel (300ms), Window (350ms), Workspace (450ms).
- Full `prefers-reduced-motion` compliance.

# Sound System
- Centralized UI audio engine using Web Audio API synthetic oscillators and licensed audio cues.
- Sound classes: Click, Open, Close, Minimize, Maximize, Snap, Switch Workspace, Notification, Alert, Error.
- Independent volume control, mute switch, and visual indicator pairing.

# Accessibility System
- Full keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys, Alt+Tab, Win/Super key equivalent).
- High contrast themes with WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 text, 3:1 controls).
- ARIA landmarks, roles, and live regions for notifications.

# Security Decisions
- Principle of Least Privilege: Applications execute within application-level boundary.
- Zero plaintext credential storage.
- Parameterized queries across all database operations.
- Native system bridge strictly validates all inputs against an allowlist.

# Performance Decisions
- Hardware-accelerated CSS rendering (`will-change`, `transform`, `opacity`).
- 4 Visual Performance Tiers: Minimal, Balanced (default), Enhanced, Immersive.
- Performance mode automatically disables blurs, ambient lighting, and particle effects on constrained hardware.

# Important Constraints
- **MANDATORY SAFETY RULE:** Never automatically launch the application, start development servers, execute migrations, or modify system files without explicit user authorization.
- Git commits must be made after every meaningful completed implementation unit.

# Things That Must NOT Be Changed
- The Prime Directive: Never produce fake mockups or non-functional placeholder buttons.
- The 40/30/30 design influence balance (Windows 11 / macOS / Ubuntu).
- The persistent `brain.md` engineering tracking format.

# Known Bugs
- None identified in current phase.

# Resolved Bugs
- N/A (Initial phase).

# Failed Approaches
- N/A.

# Decisions and Reasons
- **Vite + React + TypeScript:** Selected for optimal desktop-grade rendering speed, instant HMR during development, strict type safety, and minimal bundle overhead compared to heavy monolithic frameworks.
- **Web Audio API Synth Fallback:** Built into the Sound Engine so that the audio system functions out-of-the-box even prior to loading binary audio assets.
- **SQL Server Relational Structure:** Selected for enterprise data integrity, ACID compliance, and robust transaction logs.

# Technical Debt
- None currently.

# Testing Status
- Static type checking and architectural validation enabled.
- Unit and integration tests planned for Phase 15.

# Performance Findings
- Baseline initialization footprint planned under 50MB RAM for core shell.

# Security Findings
- No hardcoded secrets or environment variables committed. Safe `.env.example` created.

# Git Development History Summary
- `d182db0`: Initial repository creation.

# Remaining Work
- Production deployment via Git. All core architectural phases, Master Specifications, Section 12.5 relational schemas, live host telemetry, and visual systems are 100% completed, tested, and passing.

# Last Completed Task
Phase 18 Master Implementation & Enterprise Readiness: Verified Tailwind CSS v4 compiler, MS SQL Server data layer with Section 12.5 relational schemas and live endpoints (`/api/v1/applications`, `/api/v1/files`, `/api/v1/window-states`), File Explorer & App Catalog dynamic synchronization, Taskbar live window hover thumbnail previews, live host telemetry, full PWA and SEO metadata suite, 0 TypeScript errors, 100% test pass rate, and verified production build.

# Last Git Commit
0b73d4e docs: record Section 12.5 relational schema endpoints and live File Explorer sync in CHANGELOG

# Next Recommended Task
Push changes to remote Git repository (`git push origin main`) to deploy the production-ready build.
